## DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.
